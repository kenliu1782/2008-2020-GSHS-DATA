The Georgia Student Wellness Survey is a brief survey designed to collect data on student wellness during the current school year. It includes questions about peer and adult social support, bullying, stress, mental health,substance abuse,and suicidal ideation. This survey is anonymous and completely voluntary meaning there is no mandatory participation rate required by GaDOE. 
The project will focus on the health and wellbeing of 9-12 grade high school students using a variety of sociometrics. This interdisciplinary project will focus on making available data in the social science, behavioral sciences, and public health-oriented areas more useful for addressing community problems and informing policy. Furthermore, the project will provide a venue for learning about real issues affecting communities using quantitative methods relevant to the social and psychological sciences. The goal of this project is to better understand high school students' health status in Georgia through analyzing the data from surveys, starting at 9th-grade entry, on high school performance and the impact of these experiences on the transitions that students make from high school to adult roles.
